# HostingStuff

This repository contains the source code for my personal website project.  
The goal of this project was to design, develop, and host a static website directly from GitHub.

## 🌐 Live Website
You can view the hosted site here: [HostingStuff on GitHub Pages](https://chishtil1730.github.io/HostingStuff/)  
*(Update the above link if you’ve hosted it somewhere else)*

## 📝 Introduction
This website is a simple static site created to showcase my web development experiments.  
It serves as a place where I practice working with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to design layouts, style components, and add interactivity.  

The project also acts as a **playground for hosting on GitHub Pages**, helping me understand how to structure and deploy web projects seamlessly.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository includes:
- **HTML** – Markup for the site pages.
- **CSS** – Stylesheets for layout and design.
- **JavaScript** – Basic interactivity and functionality.
- **C/C++ & CMake files** – Additional code experiments included in the repo (not part of the live website).
- **Assets** – Images, resources, and other static files used on the site.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
